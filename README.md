# Color Detection Software  
Hello Everybody.ðŸ‘‹ I hope you all are fine.ðŸ˜Š  
I tried to make software that can detect and extract the RGB value of that particular color from any image.  
  
**So, What is color detection?**  
Color detection is the process of detecting the name of any color.   
  
Well, for humans this is an extremely easy task. We can recognize color by just looking. but it is a very difficult task for a computer.   
In the real world, human eyes can detect and differentiate colors from predefined recognition or by experience from traditional learning.  
After then the eyes can sense the color it sees and the mind interprets what that color is. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light receptors which are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. And then the brain recognizes the color.  
  
Basically, colors are made up of **3** primary colors; that are **RED, GREEN,** and **BLUE.**  
All colors in the world are made up of these primary colors with a different values. Each color has its own RGB value. Here, RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue.We define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. So, in how many ways we can define a color? There are approximately **16.5** million different ways to represent a color. For humans, it is hard to remember all color names.
In computer vision, the color detection mechanism is almost the same as in human eyes but it should be programmed using algorithms and some logic procedures that enable the CPU to take that piece of color and apply the proper mathematical and logical operations to take a decision of what color that piece includes according to its recognition about all color names.  
  
This program is performing an extraction for getting the RGB Color Histogram values from the image. Those RGB values leading and worldwide used by designers, artists, professionals, developers, scientists, and color-blinds.
